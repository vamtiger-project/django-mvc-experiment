Title:
Gig manager for Jamé Forbes

Description:
Play around with creating a generalized content management system, using friend and independent artist Jamé Forbes.

Play around with using pure javascript to experiment with CSS positioning and transition. Don't use any external libraries or frameworks to gain a firmer grasp of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Create an alternative database administration interface than Django's default Admin. Django admin is great, but it doesn't really leverage off some of HTML 5's more advanced MVC features.

Allow the user to read, update and delete records from the database.

Play around with various filters for the user to more efficiently manage data.

Allow the user to export a website including gig information as well as being able to export to Exel.
